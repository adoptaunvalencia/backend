Importance of Creating a New Branch When Cloning the Repository

Once you clone the repository, it is essential to create a new branch immediately before starting to work. This step is key to ensuring orderly and collaborative code management. By working on an independent branch, you avoid modifying the main code in the main or master branch, which makes tracking changes easier, reduces conflicts when merging code, and allows for better team organization.

Remember: creating a new branch at the start of each new task helps keep the repository clean and makes code reviews simpler and more effective.
